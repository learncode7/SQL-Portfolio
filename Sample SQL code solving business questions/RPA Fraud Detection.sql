-- Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. Help your finance department identify potentially risky transactions before they finish processing.

-- 1
-- What are the column names?
SELECT * FROM transaction_data
LIMIT 10;

-- 2
-- Find the full_names and emails
-- of the transactions listing 20252 as the zip code.
SELECT full_name, email, zip
FROM transaction_data
WHERE zip = 20252;

-- 3
-- The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name. Use a query to find the names 
-- and emails associated with these transactions.
SELECT full_name, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE full_name = 'Art Vandelay'
OR full_name LIKE '% der %';


-- 4
-- Find the ip_addresses and emails listed with these transactions - the ones with IP address beginning with '10.'
SELECT ip_address, email
FROM transaction_data
WHERE ip_address LIKE '10.%';



-- 5
-- Find the emails in transaction_data with
-- ‘temp_email.com’ as a domain.

SELECT email FROM transaction_data
WHERE email LIKE '%temp_email.com';



-- 6
-- The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. 
-- They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting 
-- with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’.

-- Can you find the transaction?
SELECT * FROM transaction_data
WHERE ip_address LIKE '120.%'
AND full_name LIKE 'John%';
